Adding non-empty element to non-empty list:
	Adding 'trois' to list 'un;deux'
	Result: 'un;deux;trois' (length is 3)

	Adding 'trois' to list 'un;deux;trois'
	Result: 'un;deux;trois;trois' (length is 4)

	Adding 'trois' to list 'un;deux;trois;trois'
	Result: 'un;deux;trois;trois;trois' (length is 5)

	Adding 'trois' to list 'un;deux;trois;trois;trois'
	Result: 'un;deux;trois;trois;trois;trois' (length is 6)

Adding ''empty'' element to non-empty list:
	Adding ' ' to list 'uno;dos'
	Result: 'uno;dos; ' (length is 3)

	Adding ' ' to list 'uno;dos; '
	Result: 'uno;dos; ; ' (length is 4)

	Adding ' ' to list 'uno;dos; ; '
	Result: 'uno;dos; ; ; ' (length is 5)

	Adding ' ' to list 'uno;dos; ; ; '
	Result: 'uno;dos; ; ; ; ' (length is 6)

Didn't work the way CGold showed in their tutorial. Has to be space in element so that not really an empty one.


Adding empty element to empty list:
	Adding '' to list ''
	Result: '' (length is 0)

	Adding '' to list ''
	Result: '' (length is 0)

	Adding '' to list ''
	Result: '' (length is 0)

	Adding '' to list ''
	Result: '' (length is 0)
